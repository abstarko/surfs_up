# Surfs Up Analysis

## Overview of Statistical Analysis
Analyzing temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results
There is a big difference in data when looking at the months of June and December.
* We can see that we have 183 more temperature readings for the month of June over December.
* The lowest temperature in December is 56, compares to June's lowest of 64. While the highest for December is 83 compared to June's 85.
* A majority (75%) of the weather in December falls between 69-74 degrees, as to where in June it falls between 73-77 degrees. 

## Summary
Looking at the overall data we can see that there isn't a huge difference in the temperatures between June and December. Temperature should not have an impact on ice cream shop sales. Just from looking at the data we don't see any issues with opening ice cream shops year round. We could always take a look at other factors that might affect sales. Are there any competitors around? Do people prefer shaved ice (very popular in hawaii) over ice cream? Does temperature / precipitation affect closing shops? Do people still want ice cream in the winter? Many other factors can take a role into whether or not ice cream shops will be successful year round.
